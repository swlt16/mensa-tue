# Welcome!

This tool fetches the mensa meal plan from the StuWe (Studierendenwerk TÃ¼bingen-Hohenheim) server and displays it nicely formatted on the stdout. There are various options to modify and filter the output, you even can save your favourite mensa in a .mensarc file.

To see all available options, just call `./mensa.py --help`.

If you want to install this tool globally on your system, just run `sudo make install`. This will make the script available under the name `mensa`.
